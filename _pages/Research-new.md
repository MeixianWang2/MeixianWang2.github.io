    Influencer marketing has become an essential component for brand strategies, and the adoption of AI-generated virtual influencers is accelerating with advancements in generative AI. However, these emerging practices raise challenges related to transparency and ethical concerns. By conducting a large field experiment involving over 1.8 million consumers, we examine the interplay between virtual influencers’ anthropomorphism levels and the disclosure of their AI identity. The results show that virtual influencers with higher anthropomorphism levels enhance engagement metrics, while AI identity disclosure reduces link clicks and three-second video plays, particularly for highly realistic virtual influencers. Our underlying mechanism analysis based on an online experiment reveals that this reduction is driven by “expectation violation effect”, where disclosure violates consumers’ expectations and evokes negative feelings. Importantly, the negative effects reverse for consumers with prior experience interacting with virtual influencers—among this group, highly realistic virtual influencers with disclosure actually lead to greater engagement than their less anthropomorphic counterparts. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the design and development of AI agents, emphasizing the need to strategically manage anthropomorphism and transparency to optimize consumer engagement.

  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    Influencer marketing has become a pivotal e-commerce strategy, revolutionizing how brands interact with consumers. This strategy’s reliance on high-profile streamers, or "superstars," presents opportunities and challenges. While these influential figures drive significant platform value, their unexpected exits pose strategic challenges for ecosystem stakeholders. This study investigates a critical yet underexplored question: how does a superstar streamer's sudden departure reshape market dynamics within LSE platforms? Using a natural experiment, the unexpected exit of Viya, China's leading live streamer from Taobao Live, we conduct an empirical case study to examine the effects on 3,102 peer streamers across 165,004 streaming sessions. Our findings reveal that peer streamers in similar content categories experience significant benefits following a superstar's exit. Notably, this improvement stems from demand redistribution rather than changes in content supply, as peer streamers maintain consistent productivity and promotional strategies post-exit. Our analysis further identifies two key moderating factors: channel similarity and streamer type. Peer streamers more similar to the departed superstar experience amplified sales gains, particularly when similarity exists in hedonic attributes like content category and popularity. Interestingly, brand-employed streamers, who represent specific brands, gained greater sales and number of views than influencer streamers. This study extends the literature on LSE, the superstar effect, and brand halo effects while offering practical implications for platform managers, brands, streamers, and consumers.

## <span style="color:#910f0f">When Prosocial Opportunities Collide: Tipping vs. Charity on Digital Platforms</span>

  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    As digital platforms integrate prosocial features into their monetization strategies, creators face a critical trade-off between sustaining income and engaging in altruistic initiatives. We study this tension in the context of Twitch’s built-in charity tool, using a quasi-experimental design based on the 2023 “Together for Good” campaign. Drawing on multi-level panel data comprising 10,704 streamer-day and 672,452 viewer–streamer–day observations, we implement difference-in-differences estimation with propensity score matching. We find that charity streams trigger short-term substitution: direct tipping declines on charity streams. However, this is followed by a long-term generosity spillover, as tipping increases in subsequent non-charity streams. Viewer-level analyses uncover a dual mechanism: active tippers reallocate spending away from tipping during charity events, while new or previously inactive viewers are more likely to initiate tipping to a streamer after exposure to the streamer’s charity events. Our study advances understanding of how platform-integrated prosocial tools reshape financial support patterns in the creator economy, offering design implications for balancing monetization and social impact.

### Personalization–Privacy Tradeoffs and AI Identity Disclosure: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment with Hyper-Realistic AI Agents
<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em; font-size:0.95em;" markdown="1">
*Meixian Wang, Jaehwuen Jung.* Field experiment & data analysis in progress. (Presented at ACR 2025)
</p>
<details style="border-left:4px solid #999; background:#f7f7f7; padding:0.6em; font-size:0.9em;">
  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    This project studies how personalization intensity (e.g., tailored scripts, imagery, and recommendations) interacts with AI identity disclosure for hyper-realistic agents in customer-facing campaigns. The field experiment randomizes (i) personalization level and (ii) disclosure timing/wording across large audience cohorts to measure effects on engagement (clicks, watch time), downstream actions (sign-ups, purchases), and privacy-sensitive behaviors (opt-outs, report/skip rates). We test whether transparency dampens response at high personalization due to perceived “creepiness” or expectation violation, and whether trust cues (safety badges, data-use notices) mitigate that tradeoff. Heterogeneity analyses focus on prior AI exposure, product involvement, and user privacy preferences, with mediation via perceived trust and relevance collected from follow-up surveys.

### AI versus Human? Investigating the Heterogeneous Effect of Online Shopping Live Streamers

  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    We compare sales and engagement performance between AI-generated and human live streamers on commerce platforms and examine when each excels. The study links stream-level outcomes (traffic, conversion, AOV, return rates) with streamer identity and content features (script structure, sentiment, pace) plus product attributes (search vs. experience goods, price points) and audience composition. Using quasi-experimental variation (schedule rotations, product assignments) and panel models with fixed effects, we estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by category risk, novelty, and viewer tenure. We also explore mechanisms—credibility/trust vs. consistency/availability—via text and voice analyses and post-stream surveys.
