      Influencer marketing has become an essential component for brand strategies, and the adoption of AI-generated virtual influencers is accelerating with advancements in generative AI. However, these emerging practices raise challenges related to transparency and ethical concerns. By conducting a large field experiment involving over 1.8 million consumers, we examine the interplay between virtual influencers’ anthropomorphism levels and the disclosure of their AI identity. The results show that virtual influencers with higher anthropomorphism levels enhance engagement metrics, while AI identity disclosure reduces link clicks and three-second video plays, particularly for highly realistic virtual influencers. Our underlying mechanism analysis based on an online experiment reveals that this reduction is driven by “expectation violation effect”, where disclosure violates consumers’ expectations and evokes negative feelings. Importantly, the negative effects reverse for consumers with prior experience interacting with virtual influencers—among this group, highly realistic virtual influencers with disclosure actually lead to greater engagement than their less anthropomorphic counterparts. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the design and development of AI agents, emphasizing the need to strategically manage anthropomorphism and transparency to optimize consumer engagement.

      As digital platforms integrate prosocial features into their monetization strategies, creators face a critical trade-off between sustaining income and engaging in altruistic initiatives. We study this tension in the context of Twitch’s built-in charity tool, using a quasi-experimental design based on the 2023 “Together for Good” campaign. Drawing on multi-level panel data comprising 10,704 streamer-day and 672,452 viewer–streamer–day observations, we implement difference-in-differences estimation with propensity score matching. We find that charity streams trigger short-term substitution: direct tipping declines on charity streams. However, this is followed by a long-term generosity spillover, as tipping increases in subsequent non-charity streams. Viewer-level analyses uncover a dual mechanism: active tippers reallocate spending away from tipping during charity events, while new or previously inactive viewers are more likely to initiate tipping to a streamer after exposure to the streamer’s charity events. Our study advances understanding of how platform-integrated prosocial tools reshape financial support patterns in the creator economy, offering design implications for balancing monetization and social impact.<img width="468" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/650efe2f-38e5-41c0-acfe-a64d27d79fb9" />

      Instabilities driven by surface energy are common in liquids but rare in solids. However, we uncovers such an instability in superlubric 2D materials: a sliding graphite flake suddenly transitions from translation into rotating motion driven by surface energy minimization. The effect highlights how surface energy can govern  superlubric systems, offering insights for controlling motion in nanoscale devices.

      Directly characterizing both surfaces of a solid-solid contact is essential but challenging at the nano- and microscale. Using a new "pick-and-flip" technique, we reveal the hidden interfaces in superlubric contacts. We confirm that superlubricity arises from two misaligned crystalline surfaces and show that its failure is caused by external defects—explaining why only some contacts exhibit superlubricity and guiding the design of ultra-low-friction systems.
