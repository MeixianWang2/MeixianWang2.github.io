  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    Influencer marketing is growing rapidly, and brands are testing AI-generated virtual influencers. In a large field experiment with 1.8M+ consumers, we study how anthropomorphism (realism) and AI identity disclosure interact. Higher anthropomorphism increases engagement, but disclosure of AI identity reduces link clicks and short video plays—especially for highly realistic agents—via an expectation-violation mechanism found in an online experiment. Among consumers with prior exposure to virtual influencers, the negative effect of disclosure reverses: highly realistic agents with disclosure outperform less anthropomorphic ones. The findings offer guidance on balancing realism and transparency when deploying AI agents for consumer engagement.

  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    We examine how the sudden exit of superstar streamers affects live streaming e-commerce ecosystems—traffic allocation, sales outcomes, and behavior of mid-tail and long-tail sellers. The study leverages platform data and quasi-experimental variation in superstar availability to assess substitution and spillover dynamics, with implications for platform resilience and creator dependency.

  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    As platforms integrate prosocial features, creators face a trade-off between monetization and altruism. Using Twitch’s built-in charity tool and a quasi-experimental design around the 2023 “Together for Good” campaign, we analyze 10,704 streamer-day and 672,452 viewer–streamer–day observations. Charity streams cause short-term substitution (direct tipping falls during charity streams) but generate a longer-term generosity spillover (tipping rises in subsequent non-charity streams). Mechanistically, active tippers reallocate spending away from tipping during charity events, while new or previously inactive viewers become more likely to initiate tipping after exposure to a streamer’s charity activities. The results inform platform design that balances revenue with social impact.

### Personalization–Privacy Tradeoffs and AI Identity Disclosure: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment with Hyper-Realistic AI Agents
<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em; font-size:0.95em;" markdown="1">
*Meixian Wang, Jaehwuen Jung.* Field experiment & data analysis in progress. (Presented at ACR 2025)
</p>
<details style="border-left:4px solid #999; background:#f7f7f7; padding:0.6em; font-size:0.9em;">
  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    This project studies how personalization intensity (e.g., tailored scripts, imagery, and recommendations) interacts with AI identity disclosure for hyper-realistic agents in customer-facing campaigns. The field experiment randomizes (i) personalization level and (ii) disclosure timing/wording across large audience cohorts to measure effects on engagement (clicks, watch time), downstream actions (sign-ups, purchases), and privacy-sensitive behaviors (opt-outs, report/skip rates). We test whether transparency dampens response at high personalization due to perceived “creepiness” or expectation violation, and whether trust cues (safety badges, data-use notices) mitigate that tradeoff. Heterogeneity analyses focus on prior AI exposure, product involvement, and user privacy preferences, with mediation via perceived trust and relevance collected from follow-up surveys.

### AI versus Human? Investigating the Heterogeneous Effect of Online Shopping Live Streamers
<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em; font-size:0.95em;" markdown="1">
*Meixian Wang, Keren Zhao, Jason Bennett Thatcher.* Data analysis & draft. (Presented at AMCIS 2022, INFORMS 2024, WITS 2024)

<details style="border-left:4px solid #999; background:#f7f7f7; padding:0.6em; font-size:0.9em;">
  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    We compare sales and engagement performance between AI-generated and human live streamers on commerce platforms and examine when each excels. The study links stream-level outcomes (traffic, conversion, AOV, return rates) with streamer identity and content features (script structure, sentiment, pace) plus product attributes (search vs. experience goods, price points) and audience composition. Using quasi-experimental variation (schedule rotations, product assignments) and panel models with fixed effects, we estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by category risk, novelty, and viewer tenure. We also explore mechanisms—credibility/trust vs. consistency/availability—via text and voice analyses and post-stream surveys.
