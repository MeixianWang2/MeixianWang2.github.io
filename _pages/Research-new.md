  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    Influencer marketing is growing rapidly, and brands are testing AI-generated virtual influencers. In a large field experiment with 1.8M+ consumers, we study how anthropomorphism (realism) and AI identity disclosure interact. Higher anthropomorphism increases engagement, but disclosure of AI identity reduces link clicks and short video plays—especially for highly realistic agents—via an expectation-violation mechanism found in an online experiment. Among consumers with prior exposure to virtual influencers, the negative effect of disclosure reverses: highly realistic agents with disclosure outperform less anthropomorphic ones. The findings offer guidance on balancing realism and transparency when deploying AI agents for consumer engagement.

  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    We examine how the sudden exit of superstar streamers affects live streaming e-commerce ecosystems—traffic allocation, sales outcomes, and behavior of mid-tail and long-tail sellers. The study leverages platform data and quasi-experimental variation in superstar availability to assess substitution and spillover dynamics, with implications for platform resilience and creator dependency.

## <span style="color:#910f0f">When Prosocial Opportunities Collide: Tipping vs. Charity on Digital Platforms</span>

<details style="border-left:4px solid #999; background:#f7f7f7; padding:0.6em; font-size:0.9em;">
  <summary style="font-size:1em;"><strong>Summary</strong></summary>
  <p style="margin:0.4em 0;">
    As platforms integrate prosocial features, creators face a trade-off between monetization and altruism. Using Twitch’s built-in charity tool and a quasi-experimental design around the 2023 “Together for Good” campaign, we analyze 10,704 streamer-day and 672,452 viewer–streamer–day observations. Charity streams cause short-term substitution (direct tipping falls during charity streams) but generate a longer-term generosity spillover (tipping rises in subsequent non-charity streams). Mechanistically, active tippers reallocate spending away from tipping during charity events, while new or previously inactive viewers become more likely to initiate tipping after exposure to a streamer’s charity activities. The results inform platform design that balances revenue with social impact.
