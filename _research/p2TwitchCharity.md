title: "Enhancing Digital Fundraising: The Impact of Charity Streams on Streamer Engagement and Donor Behavior"

---

Abstract
---
Motivated by incorporating charity streams on live streaming platforms, we investigate how adopting charity streams impacts streamers' engagement and economic performance. Our setting is on a live streaming platform, Twitch, which launched its charity tool to enable viewers to choose between supporting streamers directly or donating to charities easily. Using a combination of coarsened exact matching and a staggered difference-in-differences estimation model, our initial findings indicate that charity streams enhance streamer viewership and followers and potentially increase donations to streamers and charities. The study fills a gap in understanding the strategic use of influencers for fundraising, offering practical insights for influencers on harmonizing prosocial activities to build their image and engage their audience.
